> Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing **BoxLang** code while learning **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**!

Inspired by [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), **BoxLings** is an interactive CLI tool that guides you through learning BoxLang fundamentals through hands-on exercises with intentional errors. You fix the code, run tests, and progress through topics at your own pace.

**What makes BoxLings special?** We teach you **TDD/BDD** alongside BoxLang! Tests are visible and part of the learning experience. Read tests first to understand requirements, then fix code to make them pass.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

You'll need BoxLang installed on your system. If you don't have it yet:

- **BoxLang 1.12+** - [Installation Guide](https://boxlang.ortusbooks.com/getting-started/installation)
- **VScode** with our BoxLang Extension - As your IDE: https://boxlang.ortusbooks.com/getting-started/ide-tooling/boxlang-ide
- Terminal with ANSI color support (Windows users: Windows Terminal, Git Bash, or WSL recommended)
- Your favorite beverage ☕ for coding fuel!

We encourage you to use BVM ([BoxLang Version Manager](https://boxlang.ortusbooks.com/getting-started/installation/boxlang-version-manager-bvm)) to manage your BoxLang versions:

```bash
# Install BVM
curl -fsSL https://install-bvm.boxlang.io/ | bash
bvm install 1.12.0
bvm use 1.12.0
boxlang --version  # Verify BoxLang 1.12.0 is active
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ortus-boxlang/boxlings.git
cd boxlings
```

### 2. Initialize Your Exercises

```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx init
```

This creates your personal `exercises/` folder (git-ignored) from the templates stored in `src/exercises/`. You only need to run this once — or again if you want a completely fresh start.

### 3. Start Learning

```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx
```

That's it! BoxLings will:

- Show you the first exercise
- Start **watch mode**
- Display the first exercise
- Auto-rerun when you save changes

---

## 🎮 How to Use

### Watch Mode (Default)

```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx
```

Watch mode automatically:

- Shows current exercise
- Watches for file changes
- Reruns exercise on save
- Shows test results (if exercise has tests)

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**

- `n` - Next exercise (after completing current)
- `h` - Show hint
- `t` - Show test file
- `l` - List all exercises
- `r` - Manually rerun current exercise
- `c` - Clear terminal
- `q` - Quit

### Run Specific Exercise

```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx run variables3
```

### Check All Exercises

```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx check-all
```

### Reset an Exercise

Restores the exercise back to its **original broken state** (from the repository source):

```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx reset variables3
```

### View the Solution

```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx solution variables3
```

If you haven't solved the exercise yet, BoxLings will warn you and ask for confirmation before showing the answer.

### Show Hint

```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx hint variables3
```

### Show Test File

```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx show-test variables3
```

### List All Exercises

```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx list
```

## � Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: boxlang"

**Solution:** BoxLang is not installed or not in your PATH.
- Verify installation: Check if BoxLang binary exists
- Add to PATH: Ensure BoxLang bin directory is in your system PATH
- Reinstall: Try [reinstalling BoxLang](https://boxlang.ortusbooks.com/getting-started/installation)

### "No exercises found" or "exercises/ folder is empty"

**Solution:** You need to run `init` first:
```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx init
```

This creates your personal `exercises/` folder from the templates.

### Watch mode not detecting changes

**Possible causes:**
- **Network drives**: Watch mode may be slower on network/cloud synced folders
- **File permissions**: Ensure BoxLings can read the exercises directory
- **Manual rerun**: Press `r` to manually rerun the current exercise

### Colors not displaying correctly (Windows)

**Solution:** Enable ANSI color support:
- Windows 10+: ANSI is supported by default in newer terminals
- Use **Windows Terminal** for best experience
- Or try **Git Bash** or **WSL**

### TestBox errors or missing tests

**Solution:** Ensure TestBox is installed:
```bash
box install
```

This installs TestBox into the `testbox/` directory (required for exercises with tests).

### "Exercise already completed" but I want to redo it

**Solution:** Reset the exercise:
```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx reset exercise-name
```

Or reset your entire progress:
```bash
rm -rf .boxlings exercises
boxlang BoxLings.bx init
```

## 🧪 TDD/BDD Learning Journey

BoxLings teaches you test-driven development alongside BoxLang:

### Step 1: Reading Tests (Topics 1-10)

**You learn to:**

- Read TestBox specs
- Understand `describe()` and `it()` blocks
- Interpret expectations: `expect().toBe()`, `expect().toInclude()`
- Use tests as documentation

**Example:**

```javascript
// Read this test FIRST
class extends="testbox.system.BaseSpec" {
    function run() {
        describe( "Variables Exercise 3", () => {
            it( "should calculate sum correctly", () => {
                // Your code should set x=10, y=20, sum=30
                expect( sum ).toBe( 30 );
            });
        });
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Understanding Patterns (Topics 11-14)

**You see:**

- Multiple assertions
- Setup/teardown (`beforeEach`, `afterEach`)
- Edge cases and error handling
- Complex test scenarios

### Step 3: Writing Tests (Topic 14: Testing)

**Now YOU write tests!**

- Practice `describe` / `it` / `expect` syntax
- Learn to think tests-first
- Write your own TestBox specs

### Step 4: TDD Practice (Topics 15-25)

**Apply full TDD cycle:**

- Write test (RED)
- Write code to pass (GREEN)
- Refactor (REFACTOR)

## 🎓 Exercise Format

### Exercises WITHOUT Tests

Simple syntax fixes - compilation is the check:

```javascript
// exercises/01_variables/variables1.bxs
// TODO: Add the missing keyword
function main() {
    x = 5;  // <-- Fix this!
    println( "x = #x#" );
}
```

### Exercises WITH Tests

**Read the test FIRST:**

```javascript
// exercises/01_variables/variables3Test.bx
class extends="testbox.system.BaseSpec" {
    function run() {
        describe( "Variables Exercise 3", () => {
            it( "should initialize x with value 10", () => {
                include "variables3.bxs";
                expect( variables.x ).toBe( 10 );
            });
        });
    }
}
```

**Then fix the exercise:**

```javascript
// exercises/01_variables/variables3.bxs
// TODO: Read variables3Test.bx first!
// TODO: Initialize x with the value 10

// Fix this
x = ???

println( "x = #x#" );
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Do I need to know CFML to use BoxLings?

**No!** BoxLings teaches BoxLang from scratch. While BoxLang has CFML compatibility, these exercises focus on modern BoxLang syntax. Prior programming experience in any language is helpful but not required.

### How long does it take to complete all exercises?

**Varies by experience:**
- Beginners: 15-20 hours
- Experienced programmers new to BoxLang: 6-10 hours
- CFML developers: 4-6 hours

You can take breaks anytime - progress is automatically saved!

### Can I skip exercises?

Yes! While we recommend doing them in order, you can run any exercise directly:
```bash
boxlang BoxLings.bx run exercise-name
```

### What's the difference between .bxs, .bx, and .bxm files?

- **`.bxs`** - Scripts (most exercises): Execute directly, no class wrapper needed
- **`.bx`** - Classes: BoxLang class files with `class { }` wrapper
- **`.bxm`** - Templates: For HTML/template mixing exercises

### Are solutions available?

Yes! Use `boxlang BoxLings.bx solution exercise-name`. BoxLings will warn you if you haven't attempted the exercise yet, but you can still view it if needed.

### Can I use BoxLings offline?

Yes! Once cloned, BoxLings runs completely offline. Only the initial clone and any future updates require internet.

### How do I update BoxLings?

```bash
cd boxlings
git pull origin main
boxlang BoxLings.bx init  # Refresh exercises with new content
```

Your progress in `.boxlings/state.json` is preserved!

### Is BoxLings suitable for teaching/workshops?

Absolutely! BoxLings is designed for self-paced learning, classrooms, workshops, and bootcamps. The progressive structure and built-in hints make it ideal for learning environments.

### Can I contribute my own exercises?

Yes! We welcome contributions. See the [Contributing](#-contributing) section for details.
